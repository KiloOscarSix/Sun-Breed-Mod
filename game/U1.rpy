N "*giggle* You have a talent for imitation. I won’t lie, that howl was rather sexy."

A "So, Mr. Wolf. What would you implore us to do right now, so that you may focus once more?"

"I think about the answer for a second."

P "(Of course I love fucking them, but when’s the last time I got proper blowjobs?)"

P "Can you suck my dick?"

"Aditi and Najah quickly move into position."

P "(I guess Najah is in a watching mood tonight.)"

N "You know I didn’t intend to injure you, right?"

with dissolve

"She plants a another kiss."

N "I would sooner die."

P "*smile* I know. You can make it up to me in a moment when Najah is done sucking me off. Deal?"

"Instead of answering, Najah starts sucking on my neck."

scene a196 #A sucking
with dissolve

"My attention is forced back to Aditi as she finally takes me into her mouth, though she stays near the tip, bobbing her head back and forth."

"The slow speed she moves at makes my toes curl in my shoes as the warm, wetness of her mouth massages me."

"And when she starts swirling her tongue right at my peehole, I suck in an involuntary breath."

N "Heh. Are you enjoying our [rel_r2] sucking your cock?"

P "*exhale* I very much do."

N "We had a disagreement who could do it better, and it seems I have my work cut out for me. I should get to work. I’m already behind."

"When it comes to sex, Najah is pretty much the opposite of Aditi and goes full throttle from the start."

"So it takes a lot of willpower to keep from cumming as she swallows my entire dick in one go and begins sucking."

"Her grip around me is just as strong as as she jerks from the tip to the base. Her energetic blowjob is loud in the quiet night, making loud, wet noises."

with dissolve

P "(I would’ve liked both of them to work on my dick, but it seems they need to settle their little contest first.)"

A "That vampire never wastes any time, does she?"

P "*laugh* That she does not…"

"I try to keep my voice even as Najah relentlessly swallows me whole, over and over again."

with dissolve

A "You know, I sometimes ponder on the moment that led us to this point."

A "Relationships such as ours are not uncommon in certain lineages, but our own hasn’t practiced for generations."

A "But after our [rel_c] was slain, you promised to protect Najah and I."

A "Do you remember?"

scene a202 #A vulnerable face
with dissolve

P "I do."

A "And as you grew into a full vampire, we became more impressed with you and offered to be your women. You were initially shocked."

P "Ha… How could I not be? My own [rel_r2]s sweared their lifelong allegiance to me, which is like human marriage times a hundred considering how long our kind live."

A "But you accepted us at that moment anyway without much delay. And we thank you for it because being with you fulfills the holes left in our hearts from that day."

"Aditi’s words make me focus on her, even with Najah's splendid blowjob still going on."

"And as usual, Najah latches on to my tip to extract every ounce of cum I can produce."

A "It looks like you really were thinking about us all day. It seems Najah can barely contain your essence."

P "(A lot of shit did go down today, so I did need a good release.)"

A "I think I can help with that."

N "*giggle* It's excellent, pervert. Is that what you want to hear?"

P "Mhm. And Aditi, do you second her opinion?"

A "Wholeheartedly. I can get back to my nap now with a full stomach."

P "Hahaha."

"Aditi does return to her nap while Najah and I resume our sparring."

"And I do my best to stay focused even with the unbelievable situation of what made me an officer in the first place returning."

"The same situation that got my [rel_c]s killed. And in a way, I’m almost relieved because I have power now."

"And I’m going to wreak havoc."
