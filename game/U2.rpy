"Not too much time passes before I officially… or unofficially, as far as the record shows, start the investigation into the mystery killings."

P "(I don’t exactly have much to go on besides the two biggest vampire gangs breaking out into war after years of tension.)"

P "(Funny that keeping Jordy and Katherine in check were our biggest problem up until days ago. And now they’re basically an afterthought.)"

scene b2 #cam closer to bar
with dissolve

P "(Anyway, let’s see if the killings and the war are related in any way. And I’ll start doing that by questioning a few of Edgar’s patrons inside the bar.)"

P "(Rumor has it that Jordy's people like to hang around here… I just hope they don’t smell I’m only half vamp. I'm hiding my scent, so hopefully it works.)"

scene b3 #cam turn around
with dissolve

P "(There’s just one small problem I have to deal with first.)"

P "I don’t know who you are or why you’re following me, but I’m going to give you three seconds to come out before I come get you myself."

P "(I just noticed them when I neared the bar, so I have no clue how long they've been tailing me…)"

P "(Is it Rex? He did practically promise a date in the future.)"

scene b6 #A walk to N

A "I warned you your proximity was too close."

P "(Aditi, too? I didn’t even notice her until she walked out just now, and I’m pretty damn good at sensing people.)"

scene b7 #N annoyed face A
with dissolve

N "If not for you, I would not be hiding in the shadows as if some milk drinker at all!"

A "Of course not, because you’re a barbarian that thinks the solution to every problem is her fists."

N "Say that again and I’ll punch you!"

P "Guys…"

P "I know you love me and all, but stalking? That’s new."

A "Is it not you who has driven us to such lengths?"

P "What?"

scene b9 #A stand in front of cam. N walking
with dissolve

N "Do you remember when you were but a boy and stole one of our [rel_c]'s trinkets?"

P "Yeah… It was after he died. I just wanted something to remember him by. Why are you asking that, though?"

A "You swore till the ends of the earth that you had not taken it, but hiding the truth became apparent in everything you did."

scene b11 #cam on N

N "You became distracted, just like you have been quite recently."

scene b10
with dissolve

A "Yes. So as I said before, it is you who has driven us to stalking you as a predator does its prey."

N "And it is the truth we seek."

scene b12 #cam look at their bodies
with dissolve

"I mentally sigh as I think of what to do or say."

N "How dare you! Do you not remember the oath we made upon becoming life partners?!"

P "I…"

scene b17 #N kneel down to grab cam
with dissolve

"Najah flies toward me and grips my shirt's collar."

scene b19 #A look at cam
with dissolve

A "We are your life partners, you belong to us and we to you. So you will tell us what is going on."

A "Or we will not let you go. And if you manage to break free, we will follow you until the ends of the earth."

N "And we won’t have sex with you anymore either! Even if you beg us and try to seduce us with your amazing dick!"

scene b18
with dissolve

A "Please do not encourage him in any way right now. He needs to know how serious we are."

scene b20 #N look at A
with dissolve

N "I know, but it IS amazing! Which makes me even angrier with the thought he would force us to give it up!"

P "(They’re just like Camilla and Valentine in terms of stubbornness… But a lot more forceful with it.)"

P "*smile* Don’t you think that’s a bit overkill, girls?"

scene b22 #NA smile
with dissolve

A "Such is the depths of our love, dear [rel_r]."

N "So, what shall it be? We stay here all night or you tell us who’s harassing you so we can rip their head off?"

scene b23 #cam look away
with dissolve

P "(We’re basically married, but way more than that. Once vampires form a pact to become life partners, it’s literally that. For life.)"

"I let the idle thought float away and focus back on my [rel_r2]s after coming to a decision."

scene b22

P "Your little speech has convinced me, but let’s move from the front of the bar, so we don’t get interrupted."

scene b27 #cam playing with toys, black and white, blurry
with dissolve

"And before I know what’s happening, I’m pulled back to that time and place."

P "I was playing with my toys while my mom and our [rel_c] were talking in the other room…"

P "(Actually, it was more like yelling, which stuck out to me because they never fought. Disagreeing? Sure, but not fighting.)"

scene b28 #FB door cam look up
with dissolve

P "But their yelling at each other was replaced by screaming… My mom screaming anyway, like she was terrified."

P "It terrified me too, because even at that age, I knew our [rel_c] was one of the strongest vampires alive."

P "But she was scared with him right there anyway…"

scene b29 #cam call phone 3rd MC hiding

P "I think I was frozen for a little while, but when I came to my senses, I called you guys to come over."

A "You actually did not utter a word."

scene b24
with dissolve

P "I didn’t?"

N "Apparently not. All Aditi relayed to me was that you were crying and inconsolable."

N "You were a sensitive boy at the time, so I paid it no credence. But Aditi persisted something was amiss and forced me to go see what the commotion was about."

scene b30 #NA look at monster about to attack MC boy
with dissolve

A "I'm glad you did relent and accompany me because I have no doubt [player_name] and I would have perished, too."

A "That beast moved like it was not of this world… As if the laws of physics did not apply to it."

scene b31 #NA fighting beast
with dissolve

N "Even with it severely injured by our [rel_c], it nearly killed us both anyway."

scene b32 #All passed out

N "But we were able to break that damned beast in half in the end."

N "It is true I have a hunger for battle, but that one still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth."

scene b33 #A smile touch cam face
with dissolve

"Aditi grabs my hand."

A "I know we lost much that day… You even moreso, but we must thank the universe we were able to get to you in time, and uninjured."

"I smile back at her, hoping she can’t tell it’s forced. Because that wasn’t the truth..."

"I HAD been injured..."

scene b34 #A look down neu move hand

A "But now you are saying it has returned… Even all these years later and we’ve learned virtually nothing from the incident."

A "Not what nature of beast it was, whether a mutation or born, nor why it decided to attack our [rel_c] and your mother at all."

scene b24
with dissolve

N "How did you learn of the beast's survival, if that’s even what it is?"

P "There’ve been vampires and humans getting fed on, just like before. So the relations directors put me on the case."

A "How many have you been put in charge of?"

P "None."

scene b35 #N angry.

P "*deep breath* I’m sorry. I’m sorry, guys. I shouldn’t lose my cool like that when you’re just worried about me."

A "Yes, [player_name]. You are strong. Honestly, stronger than you have any right to be as a half vampire…"

scene b37 #A look away
with dissolve

A "However, if you fight that monster alone…"

"It hurt. Even though Aditi didn’t finish her statement, it hurt. Because it might be the truth."

P "(Have I been deluding myself this whole time…? Am I really not strong enough?)"

P "(Maybe… maybe I should stop taking the serum…?)"

scene b38 #A look at N smile

scene b39 #A smile

scene b36

P "But no, guys. I mean that we’re a team."

P "(It’s clear they aren’t going to let me do this alone, so I’ll let them tag along for the investigation.)"

P "(But I still don’t like this. They’re in danger and I may not be strong enough to protect them when the time comes.)"

scene b42 #NA smi at cam
with dissolve

N "Oh! A team just like with the Dominion. You should have just said that!"

P "I… did…"

A "We truly do understand the reason you would keep this to yourself, [rel_r], but we will be able to help."

A "Such as providing access to places and resources you would not as a young vampire."

scene b38
with dissolve

N "Not to mention the connections we have built over the years. I am owed plenty of favors from my youth."

P "(Sometimes I forget how old Najah and Aditi really are, with how young they look. But they’ve always looked this way in my life.)"

P "How old are you guys now, by the way?"

scene b42

N "Sixty-two!"

A "I will be sixty-three this year."

P "*grin* Hottest grandmas ever."

scene b39

N "Ugh, I do not understand your stupid human jokes!"

A "*giggle* It is because we would be considered elderly in human years. Is that not correct, [player_name]?"

N "Mmmm… I suppose."

scene b36
with dissolve

P "Alright, now that we have all of that out of the way, let's get down to business."

P "The bar here is where Jordy's gang supposedly hangs out, so we need to find out if the war with him and Katherine has anything to do with this thing coming back."

A "Understood. You have actually gone through officer training, so of course we will follow your lead, and help out where we can."

P "And Najah, NO ATTACKING ANYONE."

scene b38

N "I understand! I will try not to!"

P "(I… guess that’s a start.)"

P "And I probably don’t need to warn you, but try not to be too obvious about digging for info."

P "Hey –"

P "Alrighty then…"

M "*giggle* Something like that, but I promise I’m MUCH easier to get along with."

N "I do not wear panties and you stole the last Dominion! And now you dare try to steal my partner?!"

scene b53 #M look at cam

M "This is your partner? I admit, you have taste. I was planning on getting a taste myself. It wouldn’t take long. I just need him for an hour or so, then you can have him back."

A "I lost count how many times he made us cum. Do you recall, by any chance, [rel_r2]?"

N "Heh. You know I was never one for maths, Aditi. But I believe it a divisible of nine."

scene b57-1 #NA look at M

P "You are so poetic with words, you know that, Najah?"

scene b61 #N face A smile
with dissolve

N "I thank you for coming to my aid, Aditi. It was not needed, but I still appreciate it."

A "You are welcome. Though admittedly it was more for my benefit. Seeing her casually touch our [rel_r] made me want to rip her eyes out and use them as decoration in our home."

P "Ha…"

P "(Just because Aditi doesn’t show her emotions doesn’t mean they’re not there.)"

EE "I’m very old. Even for a vampire. You don’t get that way by sticking your nose into other's business."

scene b64 #E look to side

EE "But I keep thinking about that kid who worked for me and was turned into a pretzel."

EE "He was not a good employee and I was going to fire him soon, but he didn’t deserve to die like that."

scene b63

EE "That’s why you’re going around my bar asking questions, is it not?"

P "Yes, it is."

EE "*sigh* I don’t really know anything, as I said the first time you asked me tonight, but I do know the war started over a specific incident."

scene b65 #E switch pose, or move hand

EE "Katherine claims that it was Jordy who initiated the war and he claims the opposite, that she was the aggressor."

P "What is this incident exactly?"

EE "That’s as far as my knowledge goes."

scene b66 #A think pose, N look at her

A "That certainly is something that at the very least requires further inquiry."

P "Yeah. I was thinking we could hear the story straight from the horse’s mouth."

scene b24

N "Gaining an audience with Jordy is no easy task. I remember from my gang days he was always paranoid, and I hear it’s only gotten worse."

P "*sigh* That’s going to make things a bit more difficult."

P "I want to avoid fighting, and sneaking into his place doesn't seem like a good way to talk to him either."

P "*laugh* Yes, thank you for helping me against my will. I don't know what I'd do without you guys."

scene b67
with dissolve

N "As I was saying, one way of gaining access to Jordy is by providing him with a unique gift."

P "That guy is loaded with the drug trafficking we’ve been trying to nail him on for years… What gift could we possibly buy him that he hasn’t already?"

N "I agree, he was wealthy even back when I was active."

scene b69 #A smile, N look at her

A "Were you even listening when I explained what we will be gifting Jordy?"

N "Of course I was! …Or at least I was trying, but sometimes you simply go on and on, and my mind wanders to other subjects like our [rel_r]'s dick."

A "*sigh* We are headed to an island where a flower is said to be rumored. And that flower mixed with certain chemicals elicits a powerful psychedelic effect."

scene b72 #N change pose

N "Correction, little [rel_r]. She STOLE the previous Dominion."

A "It was rumored she was sleeping with two out of five judges, so they voted in her favor after the final fight."

scene b87 #A look forward
